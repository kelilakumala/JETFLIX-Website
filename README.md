# JETFLIX-Website
A frontend website of a streaming-based platform similar to Netflix using HTML, JS, and CSS while incorporating Human Computer Interaction concepts.

This project focuses on sharpening web design skills as well as creativity and aesthetic, focusing on color, font choice, and layout. The design also includes CSS features to create a responsive website. 

This website consists of 6 pages that have all been designed on Figma as the prototype. The _JETFLIX Documentation - Kelila.docx_ file explains the features and how-to of the website.

_This website was created for a BINUS University's Human-Computer Interaction course and is not intended for public hosting or official launch. Any resemblance to existing work is purely coincidental and not intended as plagiarism._
